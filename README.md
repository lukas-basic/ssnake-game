## Total time

**The time it took me to develop requirements for the game was around 5 hours.**

At the begining, I needed to take few hours to research how to use Vue.js since this was my first time using Vue. After that, I had to take some time to prepare myself, making sure I'm planning to use the right steps to build this game, since this was my second time building a game. When the foundation of the game was set, the next step was to work on the design (including visual and sound effects). All the drawings included in the game were made using the https://www.pixilart.com/ and the sound effects were downloaded from https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/ and https://freesound.org/. The time it took me to develop requirements for the game was around five hours, while the optional features took about an hour and a half.
